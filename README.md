# SPA Meal Prep app

I wanted to play around with a different approach to make a SPA where I load the majority of the content upfront in the html. I want to figure out what effect this would on page load and how I would effect the over all UX.

## Installation

To mess around with the project on your own, follow these steps:

1. Clone repo on you local machine:

```

git clone https://github.com/chr1swill/spa-meal-prep.git
```

2. Navigate into project directory:

```

cd spa-meal-prep/
```

3. Install project dependencies using npm:

```

npm -i
```
